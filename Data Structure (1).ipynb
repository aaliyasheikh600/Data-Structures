What are data structures, and why are they important ?\n","    - Data structures are specialized formats for organizing, storing, and accessing collections of data.\n","    hey provide efficient ways to manage information based on its\n","characteristics and intended use.\n","    # Importance of Data Structures\n","\n","\n","*   Choosing the right data structure significantly impacts the efficiency and\n","performance of your program.\n","*   Well-chosen data structures can:\n","*   Simplify data manipulation (adding, removing, modifying elements)\n","*   Optimize searching and sorting operations\n","*   Conserve memory usage\n","\n","2.  Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples\n","    # Mutability & Immutability.\n","     - In Python, objects can be either changeable (modifiable) or unchangeable (unchangeable).\n","     - Mutable objects, such as lists and dictionaries, can be modified after creation, while immutable objects, such as tuples and strings, cannot.\n","     - Mutability affects how objects are stored and manipulated in memory, impacting performance, memory usage, and concurrency in Python programs.\n","\n","\n","3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n","    - In Lists you can add, remove, or modify elements within a list using indexing and slicing. Lists are versatile for storing and managing collections that might change\n","    - In Touples you can access elements using indexing and slicing, but you cannot modify the content. Tuples are useful for representing fixed datasets or configurations.\n","\n","4. Describe how dictionaries store data?\n","   - Dictionaries in Python are unordered collections that store data as key-value pairs. Each key is associated with a value, and this key-value pair is used to efficiently retrieve or manipulate data\n","   -Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs and use a hashing mechanism to organize the data efficiently.\n","   -Keys must be immutable, while values can be of any data type.\n","   -Dictionaries are unordered, meaning there’s no guarantee of the order in which items are stored.\n","   -Operations like adding, accessing, and removing key-value pairs are efficient, typically happening in constant time (O(1)) due to the hashing mechanism.\n","\n","5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n","   # You might use a set instead of a list in Python when:\n","\n","   - Uniqueness is required – Sets automatically remove duplicate elements, whereas lists allow duplicates.\n","   - Fast membership testing – Checking if an item exists in a set (x in set) is faster (O(1) on average) than in a list (O(n)).\n","   - Set operations are needed – Sets support efficient operations like union, intersection, and difference, which are more cumbersome with lists.\n","  - Order is not important – Unlike lists, sets are unordered, so they are useful when order doesn’t matter.\n","\n"," 6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n"," - Defiinition : Characters arranged in an unchangeable order. Consider writing a sentence, a paragraph, or a piece of material.\n"," - Difference :\n","    1. An ordered collection of elements.\n","    2. Can hold different data types (integers, strings, other lists, etc.).\n","    3. Mutable (can be modified).\n","\n","7.  How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python ?\n","-  Tuples are immutable to ensure that their contents remain constant throughout their lifecycle, guaranteeing data integrity and reliability. This immutability allows tuples to be used as keys in dictionaries and elements in sets, as they can be hashed.\n","\n","8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in python ?\n","-  In Python, the Dictionary data types represent the implementation of hash tables. The Keys in the dictionary are hashable–they are generated by a hash function which generates a unique result for each unique value supplied to the hash function. Also, the order of data elements in a dictionary is not fixed.\n","\n","9. Can lists contain different data types in Python ?\n","-  Although it's not really common, a list can also contain a mix of Python types including strings, floats, and booleans.\n","\n","10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python ?\n","-  Memory Efficiency: Since immutable objects cannot change their value, Python can optimize memory usage. Reusing the same immutable object across the program whenever possible reduces memory overhead. Thread Safety: Immutability provides inherent thread safety.\n","\n","11.  What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks ?\n","- Dictionaries excel at tasks involving fast lookups and storing data as key-value pairs, whereas lists are better for ordered collections and sequence operations.\n","\n","12.  Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list ?\n","-  Use a list if you need a mutable collection of items where you may need to add, remove, or change elements. Lists are more flexible and have more built-in methods, making them ideal for dynamic collections. Use a tuple if you need an immutable collection where the elements won't change after creation.\n","\n","13.   How do sets handle duplicate values in Python ?\n","-   Use a list if you need a mutable collection of items where you may need to add, remove, or change elements. Lists are more flexible and have more built-in methods, making them ideal for dynamic collections. Use a tuple if you need an immutable collection where the elements won't change after creation.\n","\n","14.  How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries ?\n","-   The key of the dictionary is a unique value as well as the set, and the execution time is about the same as for sets. On the other hand, dictionary values can be duplicated like a list. The execution time of in for values() is about the same as for lists. Key-value pairs are unique.\n","\n","15.  Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not .\n","-   No, you cannot directly modify the elements of a tuple in Python because tuples are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation.\n","\n","16.   What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case ?\n","-     A nested dictionary is a dictionary where the values are themselves dictionaries, allowing for a hierarchical data structure. A practical use case is representing structured data like JSON or storing multiple related datasets, such as employee details for different departments.\n","\n"," 17.  Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.\n"," -    Accessing elements in a dictionary (or hash map) by key has an average time complexity of O(1), meaning it takes constant time, regardless of the dictionary's size.\n","\n","18.  In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries ?\n","-    For quick data look-ups, configurations, or caches, favor dictionaries. For ordered collections and sequence operations, such as maintaining a stack or queue, lists are more suitable.\n","\n","19.   Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval ?\n","-     Dictionaries are considered unordered because they don't maintain a specific order of elements based on insertion, unlike lists or tuples. This means data retrieval is based on keys, not positions, and the order of keys in a dictionary can vary during iteration or printing.\n","\n","20.   Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n","-     In data retrieval, lists access elements by their numerical index (starting from 0), while dictionaries access elements (values) by their unique key, offering faster lookups for specific data based on identifiers.\n","\n"," practical questions\n","\n"," 1.  Write a code to create a string with your name and print it.\n"," -   The simplest way to print something is to use the printf() function. You can provide your name in the form of string to printf() function and it will print it on the output screen.\n","\n"," 2.   Write a code to find the length of the string \"Hello World\"\n"," -   In the above code, we first declare and initialize a string str using the syntax: char str[] = “Hellooo, World!”; We then calculate the length of the string using strlen(str) and store the result in the integer variable len. Finally, we print the length of the string using printf().  \n","\n"," 3.    Write a code to slice the first 3 characters from the string \"Python Programming\"\n"," -    String slicing in Python is a way to get specific parts of a string by using start, end, and step values. It’s especially useful for text manipulation and data parsing.\n","\n","Let’s take a quick example of string slicing:\n","s = \"Hello, Python!\"\n","\n","# Slice string from index 0 to index 5 (exclusive)\n","s2 = s[0:5]\n","\n","print(s2)\n","\n","4.
